	<h3>What is our story?</h3>
  <p> Personnaly, I experienced a bad moment. As my parent getting divroced, I had
		the full access to my father's wine cellar, for a while.
		But unfortunatly, many of the bottles were passed. As now I work in the wine
		 and tech industries for more than 4 years, I started to look for a solution
		 that can fix my problem: knowing when it is time to drink a wine.</p>
	<hr />
	<h4>Why creating whenwine?</h4>
	<p> It does exist so many solutions, apps and other stufs to help you handling
		your wine cellar. Unfortunatly very few of them tell you when it is time to
		drink your wines before they pass.
		The few solutions that exist are solutions based on machine learning and use
		powerful and complexe algorithms to do so. The most suprising it they  still
		 need the winemaker to said when the wine is good to drink or not.
		WhenWine addresses the same problem that theses applications using machine
		learning but does not use machine, we build a wine community helping people each other.</p>
		<hr />
		<h4>Why this pricing system?</h4>
		<p> I know that the more we are and the better WhenWine will be. So the value
			created by the application raise with the number of users. By thinking so,
			the prices trend should go up with the number of people. If you think this way,
			you are going to spend a lot (really a lot) of monney to attract enough people to
			create a tremoundus wine lovers community. On the contrary, if everybody has an interest
			to join the community because the price fall for everybody, we can probably experience a nice growth.</p>
